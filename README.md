## How to Integrate

### Step 1: Add the Library to Your Project

You can include the `cigalpay-crypto-card` in your project either by linking directly to the CDN-hosted version or by downloading the files and hosting them yourself.

#### **Option 1: Using CDN**

Simply include the following links in your HTML file.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cigalpay/cigalpay-crypto-card/css/crypto-card.css">
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cigalpay/cigalpay-crypto-card/js/crypto-card.js" defer></script>
```

#### **Option 2: Download and Host Locally**

1. Download the repository and extract the files to your project directory.
2. Link the `css` and `js` files as shown below:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/cigalpay-crypto-card/css/crypto-card.css">
<script src="path/to/cigalpay-crypto-card/js/crypto-card.js" defer></script>
```

### Step 2: Add the HTML Structure

To render the cryptocurrency selection cards, use the following HTML structure in your page:

```html
<div class="container mt-5">
    <h2 class="mb-4 text-center font-weight-bold">Select a Cryptocurrency for Payment</h2>
    <div class="row justify-content-center" id="crypto-container"></div>

    <p class="mt-4 text-center fs-5">Selected Coin: <strong id="selectedCoin">None</strong></p>
</div>
```

The `id="crypto-container"` is where the cards will be dynamically rendered.

### Step 3: Customize and Render Cards

Add the following JavaScript to render the cards dynamically and handle the user's selection. You can also provide a custom handler function that will be called when a coin is selected.

```html
<script>
    // Custom handler function that will be called when a user selects a coin
    function customCoinSelectedHandler(data) {
        alert(`You selected ${data.coinName} with price: $${data.price}`);
        // Implement any custom logic you need here
    }

    // Render the crypto cards and pass the custom handler function
    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
        renderCryptoCards('crypto-container',5,customCoinSelectedHandler);
    });
</script>
```

### Step 4: Explanation of the Code

1. **HTML Structure**
   - The `crypto-container` `div` will hold the rendered cryptocurrency cards.
   - The `<strong id="selectedCoin">None</strong>` element will display the name of the selected cryptocurrency.

2. **Dynamic Price Fetching**
   - The `renderCryptoCards` function fetches live cryptocurrency prices from the CoinGecko API and renders the cards with the updated prices.
   - The prices are dynamically calculated based on the article price (set to `$2` by default) and the current price of the selected coin.

3. **Custom Handler**
   - The `customCoinSelectedHandler` function is a callback that is triggered when a user clicks on a card. It provides the `coinName` and `price` of the selected coin as an object, allowing you to implement your custom logic (e.g., updating your payment gateway or processing the payment).

4. **Coins Supported**
   - The library supports **Bitcoin (BTC)**, **Ethereum (ETH)**, **Litecoin (LTC)**, **Dogecoin (DOGE)**, **Dash (DASH)**, **Solana (SOL)**, and **Polygon (MATIC)**.
   - You can modify the list of supported coins by editing the `cryptoCoins` array in the JavaScript file.
